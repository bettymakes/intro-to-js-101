// Exercises: simple loops

// Introducing the FOR loop! 
// for(initial state; condition; iterator/incrementer)
// Print out numbers 0 to 9






// EXERCISE: Multiplication Tables

// Write a "for" loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the 
// for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18).




// EXERCISE: The even/odd reporter

// Write a "for" loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will
// check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen 

// This formula checks for even numbers => <number> % 2 === 0 
// This formula checks for odd numbers => <number> % 2 === 1
// Let's understand why!
